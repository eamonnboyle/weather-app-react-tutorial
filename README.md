# Weather App

This is a simple React App that shows daily weather at various locations. 
It's the code to accompany a React tutorial provided by Instil Software. By following
the code and tutorial you'll gain insight into,

- React with TypeScript
- React Hooks
- Async Communication
- Basic Styling

You'll learn this in more depth and lots more advanced topics in Instil's full
[React](https://instil.co/courses/react-and-redux/) course. We write all our 
own content, so we're happy to customise to meet your needs, including:

- Using JavaScript of TypeScript
- Redux
- Hooks vs Classes
- Advanced Styling
- Routing
- Lazy Loading
- Testing
- and more


## Core Dependencies

This project was boot-strapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react
-app).

The app uses [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) for the data and 
**you will need to register** and generate a free API Key.
Once you have the key, set an environment variable called
`OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` to the key. This will be built into the app and used with
requests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
