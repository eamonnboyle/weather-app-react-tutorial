# Weather App

This is a simple React App that shows daily weather at various locations. 
It's the code to accompany a React tutorial provided by Instil Software. By following
the code and tutorial you'll gain insight into,

- React with TypeScript
- React Hooks
- Async Communication
- Basic Styling

You'll learn this in more depth and lots more advanced topics in Instil's full
[React](https://instil.co/courses/react-and-redux/) course. We write all our 
own content, so we're happy to customise to meet your needs, including:

- Using JavaScript of TypeScript
- Redux
- Hooks vs Classes
- Advanced Styling
- Routing
- Lazy Loading
- Testing
- and more


## Core Dependencies

This project was boot-strapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react
-app).

The app uses [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) for the data and 
**you will need to register** and generate a free API Key.
Once you have the key, set an environment variable called
`REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` to the key. This will be built into the app and used with
requests.

## Steps

There are 6 versions of the app to align with steps in the tutorial.

To run a step in development mode go into the relevant folder and execute:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
